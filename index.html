		<p class="pSize2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher, also called a schoolteacher or formally an educator, is a person who helps students to acquire knowledge, competence, or virtue.The primary role of a teacher is to deliver classroom instruction that helps students learn. To accomplish this, teachers must prepare effective lessons, grade student work and offer feedback, manage classroom materials, productively navigate the curriculum, and collaborate with other staff.</p>
		<p class="pSize2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although how much define the word "teacher" in any dictionary, as for me "teacher" is the most invaluable word for my life because they can change the image of my life.</p>

		<p class="pSize2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my childhood days, the most unforgettable teachers are the english teachers because English was my favourite subject.I think the fact that "all my English teachers are very good at teaching " is lucky one for me.</p>
		<p class="pSize2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daw Mar Mar Latt is my first favourite English teacher. She taught me from grade 6 to grade 9. I think I started loving English because of her. </p>
		<p class="pSize2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another unforgettable English teacher is U Tin Maung Than from Guiding Star. I started attending his class at the monastery after matriculation exam.From that time , I attended his classes for ages.</p>

		<p class="pSize2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a word " သင်ဆရာ၊ မြင်ဆရာ ၊ ကြားဆရာ " in our myanmar language. It means that the teacher is everyone who teaches us anything by anyway. </p>
		<p class="pSize2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, we can learn anything by social media.So I have a lot of teachers from SNS. I proudly described some of them above.</p>
		<p class="pSize2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the last teacher I want to describe is Dr. Myat Mon Aye. Although she was one of my university friends, now I am learning the programming at her online class <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SRNMDY">StudyRightNow</a>. </p>
		<p class="pSize2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is very good at teaching. Although I was over university for ages, I haven't any difficulties in the lessons because of her lectures. I could find myself again because of her.  I could also make this video because of her. I am indescribably thank her for everything. </p>
